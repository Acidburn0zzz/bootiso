**Create a USB bootable device from an ISO image easily and [securely](#security).**

Don't want to messup with the system with `dd` command? Create a bootable USB from an ISO in one line.

### Synopsis

    bootiso [<options>...] <file.iso>

Note that **short POSIX options can be stacked** as of **v2.4.0**, like so: `-Jaybd /dev/sde`

### Examples

Provide the ISO as first argument and you'll be prompted to select from available USB drives amongst a list extracted from `lsblk`. If there is only one USB device connected, `bootiso` will automatically select it:

    bootiso myfile.iso

Or provide explicitly the USB device. Command fails and exit if the provided device is not USB, such as sata:

    bootiso -d /dev/sde myfile.iso

Add a [syslinux bootloader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYSLINUX) to increase the odds your device will be bootable:

    bootiso -bd /dev/sde myfile.iso

Use `dd` instead of mount + `rsync`:

    bootiso --dd -d /dev/sde myfile.iso  

List available USB drives and exit:

    bootiso -l  


### Quick install

    curl -L https://rawgit.com/jsamr/bootiso/latest/bootiso -O
    chmod +x bootiso

Optionally, move the script to a bin path

    mv bootiso <bin-path>

Where `bin-path` is any folder in the `$PATH` environment such as `$HOME/bin`.

### Security checks and robustness

✔ bootiso asserts that selected ISO has the correct mime-type and exit if it doesn't (with [file](https://askubuntu.com/a/3397/276357) utility).  
✔ bootiso asserts that selected device is connected through USB preventing system damages and exit if it doesn't (with [udevadm](https://askubuntu.com/a/168654/276357) utility).  
✔ bootiso asserts that selected item is not a partition and exit if it doesn't (with `lsblk`).  
✔ bootiso prompts the user for confirmation before erasing and paritioning USB device.  
✔ bootiso will handle any failure from a command properly and exit.  
✔ bootiso will call a cleanup routine on exit with `trap`.  
✔ bootiso is being carefully linted and validated with [shellcheck](https://www.shellcheck.net/) (see travis build status).

This script will also check for dependencies and prompt user for installation (works with `apt-get`, `yum`, `dnf`, `pacman`, `zypper`, `emerge`).

### What it does

This script walks through the following steps:

1. Request sudo.
2. Check dependencies and prompt user to install any missing.
3. If not given the `--no-mime-check option`, assert that provided ISO exists and has the expected `application/x-iso9660-image` mime-type via `file` utiltiy. If the assertion fails, exit with error status.
4. If given with `-d`, `--device` option, check that the selected device exists and is not a partition. Otherwise, prompt the user to select a device and perform the above-mentioned controls.
5. If not given the `--no-usb-check` option, assert that the given device is connected through USB via `udevadm` utility. If the assertion fails, exit with error status.
6. If not given the `-y`, `--assume-yes` option, prompt the user for confirmation that data might be lost for selected device if he goes to next step.
7. Unmount the USB if mounted, blank it and delete existing partitions.
8. Create a FAT32 partition on the USB device.
9. Create a temporary dir to mount the ISO file and mount it.
10. Create a temporary dir to mount the USB device and mount it.
11. Copy files from ISO to USB device.
12. If option `--bootloader` is selected, install a bootloader with syslinux in slow mode.
13. Unmount devices and remove temporary folders.

### Credits

This script was made after [this askubuntu post answer from Avinash Raj](https://askubuntu.com/a/376430/276357) to automate the described steps in a robust, secured way ([see the security section for more details](#security)).
